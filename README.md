# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This classic word-guessing game is implemented using Streamlit.

## Overview

Hangman is a simple and entertaining game where players attempt to guess a hidden word, letter by letter. Incorrect guesses result in a visual representation of a hangman, and the game continues until the word is guessed or the player runs out of lives.

## How to Play

1. Click on 'Tap to play' in the sidebar.
2. Use the clickable alphabet buttons to guess letters.
3. Each correct guess reveals the corresponding letters in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses reduce your lives (displayed by the hangman stages).
5. The game ends when you guess the entire word or run out of lives.
